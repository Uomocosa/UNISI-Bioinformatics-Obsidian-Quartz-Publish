##### Questions
- ***What is the Difference of Gene and Genome?***
	- ==A genome is the complete set of genetic information (DNA or RNA) that an organism possesses==. <br>It includes all of an organism's genes, as well as any non-coding regions of DNA or RNA that may have functional or structural roles.
	- A gene, on the other hand, is a specific sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a functional product, such as a protein or RNA molecule. <br>Genes can be thought of as the fundamental units of inheritance, and they provide the instructions for building and maintaining an organism's structure and function.
	- ==In summary, a genome refers to the entire set of genetic material within an organism, while a gene is a specific sequence of DNA or RNA that provides the instructions for a particular biological function==.
