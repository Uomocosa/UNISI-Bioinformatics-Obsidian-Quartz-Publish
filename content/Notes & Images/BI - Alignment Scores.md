> Useful numbers to evaluate numerically how good the alignment is:
> - $S$ : alignment score, calculated with a defined score function.
> - $E$ : proportioanl to the expected number of random sequences with an alignment score $\ge S$. ($E \le 10^{-3}$ is statistically significant, but we often find $E \le 10^{-50}$, much better)
> - $P$ : represents the proability that the database contains one or more random sequences with score $\ge S$.
> 
> Usign $E$ and $P$ we can infer how much the result is obtained by chance
