##### Questions
- ***How is Gene Expression Regulated?***
	- ==Gene expression is regulated through a complex network of molecular mechanisms that control when, where, and how genes are turned on or off==. <br>There are several levels at which gene expression can be regulated, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation. Some of the key mechanisms involved in gene expression regulation are:
	  1. **Transcriptional regulation**: This is the most common level of gene expression regulation, and it involves ==controlling the rate of transcription of a gene==. <br>This can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including the binding of transcription factors to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of a gene, the modification of chromatin structure, and the regulation of RNA polymerase activity.
	  2. **Post-transcriptional regulation**: This level of gene expression regulation occurs after transcription, and involves ==controlling the processing, stability, and **translation** of mRNA molecules==. <br>This can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, mRNA degradation, and microRNA-mediated repression.
	  3.  **Translational regulation**: This level of gene expression regulation occurs during the process of translation, and involves ==controlling the **rate** and **efficiency** of protein synthesis==. <br>This can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including the *regulation of ribosome activity*, the presence of regulatory elements in the 5' or 3' untranslated regions of an mRNA molecule, and the control of mRNA localization.
	  4.  **Post-translational regulation**: This level of gene expression regulation occurs after protein synthesis, and involves ==controlling the **activity**, **localization**, and **stability** of proteins==. <br>This can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including protein folding, protein modification (e.g. *phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination*), protein-protein interactions, and protein degradation.
