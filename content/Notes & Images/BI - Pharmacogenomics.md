##### Questions
- ***What is Pharmacogenomics?***
	- ==Pharmacogenomics is the study of how an individual's genetic makeup affects their response to drugs. <br>It involves the analysis of genetic variations that can influence the efficacy and safety of drugs, and the development of personalized treatment plans based on an **individual's genetic profile**==.
	- Pharmacogenomics combines the fields of pharmacology and genomics to understand how genetic differences among individuals can affect their response to drugs. <br>By analyzing an individual's genetic profile, doctors and researchers can predict how a patient may respond to a particular drug, and tailor the dosage or choice of drug accordingly.
	- Pharmacogenomics has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine by enabling the development of personalized treatment plans for patients. <br>By identifying genetic variations that affect drug response, doctors can select the most effective and safe drug for each patient, minimizing the risk of adverse side effects or drug interactions.
	- Pharmacogenomics has already had a significant impact on the field of oncology, where genetic testing is used to guide the choice of chemotherapy drugs for cancer patients. <br>It is also being used in other areas of medicine, such as cardiology, psychiatry, and infectious diseases, to optimize drug therapy and improve patient outcomes.
	- Overall, pharmacogenomics is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to transform the practice of medicine by enabling personalized treatment plans based on an individual's genetic profile.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE ***Pharmacogenomics***:
> The relatively new field of **pharmacogenomics** (closely related ot that of **precision medicine**) aims to maximize the effectivness of treatments while minimazing unwanted side effects, using information about the genetic makeup of individuals and how their gene expression patterns change in response to various therapies

> #IMPORTANTE The microarray techique, with probes for 6817 different human genes, indicates that, between the two types of cancer, there are significant differences in the expression level of 30 genes, this changes can be detremental to the kind treatment a pation has to take, the sooner we identify the correct treatment, the higher the chance of survival.
