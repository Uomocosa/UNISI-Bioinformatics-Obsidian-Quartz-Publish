##### Questions
- ***What are the Differences between PAM and BLOSUM Matricies?***
	- PAM (Point Accepted Mutation) and BLOSUM (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix) matrices are both commonly used for sequence alignment, but they differ in several ways:
	  1. **Calculation**: PAM matrices are based on evolutionary distances between sequences, while BLOSUM matrices are based on blocks of conserved sequences.
	  2. **Scale**: PAM matrices are scaled in units of evolutionary time, while BLOSUM matrices are scaled in terms of sequence similarity.
	  3. **Usage**: ==PAM matrices are generally used for aligning very closely related sequences, while BLOSUM matrices are used for more distantly related sequences==.
	  4. **Matrix size**: PAM matrices are typically larger than BLOSUM matrices, as they require more information to accurately model evolutionary distances.
	  5. **Matrix version**: PAM matrices have several different versions (PAM1, PAM250, PAM350, etc.), while BLOSUM matrices have different versions based on the level of sequence similarity (BLOSUM30, BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, etc.).
	  6. **Performance**: The performance of PAM and BLOSUM matrices can vary depending on the specific alignment problem and the type of sequences being compared. <br>In general, PAM matrices may perform better for aligning very closely related sequences, while BLOSUM matrices may perform better for more distantly related sequences.
	- Overall, the choice between PAM and BLOSUM matrices will depend on the specific alignment problem and the characteristics of the sequences being compared.
