- ***What is an Operon?***

> #IMPORTANTE An “***operon***” is a gene regulation technique found mostly in **prokeryotes** and in a few **eukaryotes**

You can think of an **operon** as a folder, a pack, of genes that are transcribed (and then translated) together, these genes have a common **promoter** and a common **operator**:

The operon can be repressed if a **repressor** binds to the **operator** and blocks the **RNA Polymerase** from transcribing.

*~Ex.: **Lac Operon***
It “packs” 3 genes for the production of enzymes that help in the process of breaking up lactose (sugar) so that bacteria can feast on its products

There is a gene that codes for the specific **repressor** for the “lac operator”, the “*lacI*”

The lactose (sugar) can bind to the represson, changing its form, so that it cannot attach to the operator:

And the **RNA Polymerase** can start making the RNA or mRNA (same thing)

> **QUINDI**: Only in the presence of *lactose* (sugar) the **repressor** is disables, and the **RNA Polymerase** can start **trascribing** the enzymes’ genes to help breake down *lactose*
