##### Questions
- ***What are the Tetriary and Quaternary Strucure of Proteins?***
	- ==Proteins can have up to four levels of structural organization: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary==.
	- ==The **tertiary structure** of a protein refers to its three-dimensional conformation, or the way in which its secondary structural elements (alpha helices, beta sheets, and loops) are folded and arranged in space. <br>Tertiary structure is determined by a combination of covalent bonds (such as disulfide bonds), electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions between amino acid side chains. <br>The tertiary structure is critical for a protein's function, as it determines its binding sites and catalytic activity==.
	- ==The **quaternary structure** of a protein refers to the way in which multiple protein subunits come together to form a larger functional complex==. <br>Some proteins, such as hemoglobin and collagen, are made up of multiple subunits that interact with each other through noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. <br>The quaternary structure is also important for protein function, as it can affect the stability, specificity, and activity of the protein complex.
	- In summary, the tertiary structure of a protein refers to its three-dimensional conformation, while the quaternary structure refers to the way in which multiple protein subunits come together to form a larger functional complex. <br>Both levels of organization are critical for a protein's function, and are determined by a combination of covalent and noncovalent interactions between amino acid residues.
- ***What are Chaperones?***
	- ==Chaperones are a class of proteins that help other proteins to fold correctly into their functional three-dimensional structures==. <br>They play a critical role in preventing misfolding and aggregation of proteins, which can lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's.
	- ==Chaperones work by binding to partially folded or unfolded proteins and stabilizing them in a conformation that allows them to continue folding correctly==. <br>==They can also help to target misfolded or aggregated proteins for degradation by the cell's quality control machinery==.
	- There are several families of chaperones, including the Hsp70/Hsp40 system, the chaperonin family (which includes GroEL and GroES in bacteria and CCT/TRiC in eukaryotes), and the small heat shock proteins (sHsps). <br>Each family has its own specific mechanisms and targets for assisting in protein folding.
	- Chaperones are essential for the proper functioning of cells, and their dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. <br>As such, they have become important targets for drug development, and several chaperone-targeting drugs are currently in clinical trials for various diseases.
