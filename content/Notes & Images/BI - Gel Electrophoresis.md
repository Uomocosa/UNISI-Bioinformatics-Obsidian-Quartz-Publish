##### Questions
- ***What is Gel Electrophoresis?***
	- ==Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate and analyze DNA, RNA, or proteins based on their size and charge==. <br>==It involves applying a sample to a gel matrix, applying an electric field across the gel, and then separating the molecules based on their migration through the gel matrix==.
	- ==The gel matrix is typically made of a porous material==, such as agarose or polyacrylamide, which forms a network of microscopic pores ==that molecules can migrate through==. <br>==The gel is placed in a buffer solution and a small electrical current is applied across the gel, creating a **charge gradient** that causes the molecules in the sample to migrate through the gel matrix towards the opposite electrode==.
	- ==During migration, the molecules are slowed down by the gel matrix, with larger molecules migrating more slowly than smaller ones. <br>As a result, the molecules become separated by size, with smaller molecules migrating further down the gel than larger ones==.
	- ==After electrophoresis is complete, the gel can be stained with a dye that binds to the molecules of interest, making them visible under UV light. <br>The separated molecules can then be visualized and analyzed, for example by measuring the distance migrated by each band or by cutting out specific bands for further analysis==.
	- Gel electrophoresis is a widely used technique in molecular biology and biochemistry for a variety of applications, such as DNA sequencing, DNA fingerprinting, and protein analysis. <br>It allows for the separation and characterization of complex mixtures of molecules, providing valuable information about their size, charge, and quantity.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE ***Gel Electrophoresis***
> Separates the molecules according to their size, smaller molecules will traverse more distance, while bigger molecules, will traverse less.
> This movement is due to the two electrods (one negative and one positive), which creates a **chrge gradient**, and since the DNA is **negatively charged**, its pieces will be drawn to the positive electrode.
