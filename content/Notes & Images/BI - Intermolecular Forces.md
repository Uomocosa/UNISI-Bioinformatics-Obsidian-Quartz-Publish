# Intermolecular Forces
We have seen three types of intermolecular forces:
- [[#Dipole-Dipole Interaction]] (between polar molecules)
- [[#Hydrogen Bonding]] (the strongest, between polar molecules with OH, NH, or FH groups)
- [[#London Dispersion Forces]] (the weakest, between non-polar molecules)
- Ion-Dipole Interaction, which can be differentiated in :
	- **Ion Dipole Forces** (for example between water and salt, where water is a **polar** molecule)
	- **Ion Induced Dipole Force** (between an ion and a **non-polar** molecule, in this case the ion induce a dipole and then bonds)
- **Ion-Ion Interaction**.

### Dipole-Dipole Interaction
Usually occurs between **polar molecules**, let’s take for example the **acetone** molecule ( C$_3$H$_6$O )

The Interaction between these two molecules is defined as *dipole-dipole* (the positive pole of one molecule is attracted to the negative pole of the other)

Another example:

### Hydrogen Bonding
A special type of *dipole-dipole* interaction, it occurs when hydrogen bonds either with **Oxygen** (O), **Nitrogen** (N) or **Fluorine** (F).

Let’s take for example the water molecule ( H$_2$O )
![[Pasted image 20221012144951.png]]

Molecules with hydrogen bonds have:
- higher **boiling points**
- higher **solubility** (for example *methanol* ( CH$_3$OH ) mixes completely with water)

With respect to molecules that do not have hydrogen bonds.


##### Solubility and Boiling Points
- Molecules with hydrogen bonds have both higher boiling points and higher solubility with respect to non-hydrogen bonds molecule.
- Between two different hydrogen bond molecule the larger one will have higher boiling point, and the more polar one will have higher solubility.

***~Ex***.: Ethanol ( CH$_3$CH$_2$OH ) vs. Dimethyl Ether ( CH$_3$OCH$_3$ )
Ethanol has the OH group, so it will have an hydrogen bond, while Dimethyl Ether will not, so the Ethanol has both higher boiling points and higher solubility.

***~Ex***.: Ethanol ( CH$_3$CH$_2$OH ) vs. Butanol ( CH$_3$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$OH )
They have both the OH group so they both have the hydrogen bond, but *butanol* has a much bigger hydrocarbon chain, it has more atoms in each molecules, as a result it will have more **London Dispersion Forces** (in addition to the hydrogen bond), so it will have higher boiling point.
While the OH group is **polar**, the CH group is **non-polar**, this is why the *ethanol* is more soluble than butanol (it is more polar overall).

### London Dispersion Forces
We can find these forces in every atom and molecule, however they are the predominant forces of **non-polar** molecules.

Starting from a non polar molecule (let’s take an atom for example, the same applies to a molecule), we start with a non-polar situation.

(The “+6” indicates that there are 6 proton in the nucleus, so there is a balance of charges)

Now due to the randomness of the electrons there could be a moment where this atom in polar, when we have more electrons in the left part of the atom for example, we define it as **polarized**:
![[Pasted image 20221012152557.png]]

This forms a *dipole* that attracts other atoms:

And since the electrons in the second atom are shifted, the second atom becomes polarized as well and we call this and “**induced dipole**”:

The forces that is then created (the yellow dotted line) is called the **London Dispersion Force**.
