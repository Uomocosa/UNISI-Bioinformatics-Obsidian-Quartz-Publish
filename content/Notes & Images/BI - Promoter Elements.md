##### Questions
- ***What are Promoter Elements?***
	- ==Promoter elements are DNA sequences that are located upstream of a gene's transcription start site and are recognized by proteins called transcription factors==. <br>These elements are essential for the initiation of transcription, which is the process of synthesizing an RNA molecule from a DNA template.
	- ==Promoter elements typically include the **core promoter** and **regulatory elements**==.
		- The **core promoter** is the region immediately upstream of the transcription start site and contains DNA sequences that are recognized by RNA polymerase and its associated factors, which are required for the **initiation of transcription**. 
		- **Regulatory elements**, on the other hand, are DNA sequences that are located further upstream of the core promoter and can **affect the activity of the core promoter** and/or the efficiency of transcription initiation.
	- There are several types of regulatory elements found in promoter regions, including **enhancers**, **silencers**, and **response elements**. 
		- **Enhancers** are DNA sequences that can increase the activity of the core promoter, leading to increased transcriptional activity.
		- **Silencers**, on the other hand, are DNA sequences that can decrease the activity of the core promoter, leading to decreased transcriptional activity.
		- **Response elements** are DNA sequences that are recognized by specific transcription factors that are activated **in response to external signals** or stimuli, allowing for rapid changes in gene expression in response to environmental cues.
	- The precise sequence and arrangement of promoter elements can vary widely between genes, contributing to the complexity and diversity of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. <br>Understanding the function and regulation of promoter elements is crucial for understanding how genes are expressed and regulated, with important implications for fields such as medicine and biotechnology.

> To classify if the promoter is **weak** or **strong** we can use an *in vivo* test, attaching the promoter to an easily recognizible gene, called a “**reporter**” that when transripted will create a **fluoroescent protein**: ![[Pasted image 20230208195307.png]]
> If the flouroescence intensity is high the promoter is **strong**, otherwise is weak: ![[Pasted image 20230208195348.png]]

> Also a promoter can be helped by a ==nerby sequence==, an **enhancer** which can influence the promoter, augmentic it’s effect, instead a **repressor** can reduce the promoter transcription effect: ![[Pasted image 20230208195454.png]]
