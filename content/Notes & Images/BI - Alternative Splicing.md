##### Questions
- ***What is Alternative Splicing?***
	- ==Alternative splicing is a process in which different combinations of **exons** within a **pre-mRNA** transcript are spliced together to generate multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene==. <br>This process is regulated by a complex network of splicing factors and can lead to the production of functionally distinct protein isoforms from a single gene.
	- The splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is typically guided by splicing signals, which are specific nucleotide sequences located at the boundaries between exons and introns. <br>Alternative splicing can occur when these splicing signals are recognized in different ways, leading to the inclusion or exclusion of different exons in the mature mRNA transcript.
	- There are several types of alternative splicing events, including **exon skipping**, **intron retention**, **alternative 5' and 3' splice site selection**, and **alternative promoter usage**. 
		- Exon skipping occurs when ==one or more exons are excluded from the mature mRNA transcript==, while intron retention occurs when one or more introns are included. 
		- Alternative 5' and 3' splice site selection occurs when ==different splice sites are used to join exons together, resulting in different combinations of exons in the mature mRNA==. 
		- Alternative promoter usage occurs when ==different promoters are used to initiate transcription of a gene, leading to the inclusion of different exons in the mature mRNA==.
	- Alternative splicing plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and is thought to be a major contributor to the diversity of protein isoforms in eukaryotic organisms. <br>Dysregulation of alternative splicing has been linked to a variety of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

> In **eukaryotes** the primary transcript of **RNA Polymerase II** is the **hnRNA** (*homogeneus RNA*), which will be relocated into the **cytoplasm**, where it will be translated, undergo a series of changes (*~ex.:* the removal of **introns**)

> #IMPORTANTE ***Alternative Splicing***:
> The alternative splicing of a single **mRNA**, can generate (after translation) mature distinct **protein isoforms**.

> Remember that:
> - Many different **eukarytic genes** can be mapped into the same **mRNA**
> - More than $90\%$ of **eukaryotic genes**, can generate multiple different **mRNA**s.

> There are five different modes in which **alternative splicing** can occur:
> 1. **Exon Skipping**: one **exon** is eliminated from the primary transcript (or preRNA or hnRNA).
> 2. **Mutually Exclusive Exons**: only one out of two **exons** is kept.
> 3. **Alternative Cutting Site in 5’**: 
> 4. **Alternative Cutting Site in 3’**: 
> 5. **Intron Retention**: an **intron** of the preRNA is kept in the mRNA.
