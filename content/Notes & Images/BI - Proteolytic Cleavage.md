##### Questions
- ***What is the Proteolytic Cleavage?***
	- ==Proteolytic cleavage, also known as **proteolysis**, is a process by which **proteins are broken down into smaller fragments or peptides through the action of proteases**, enzymes that specifically cleave peptide bonds between amino acid residues==.
	- ==Proteolytic cleavage is an important mechanism for regulating protein activity, as it can **activate** or **inactivate** proteins by removing or altering specific regions of the protein==. <br>In some cases, proteolytic cleavage can also lead to the release of functional domains or signaling peptides that can have biological activity on their own.
	- ==Proteolytic cleavage can occur in a variety of cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and extracellular space==. <br>The specific proteases involved in proteolytic cleavage can vary depending on the protein and the cellular context, and may include enzymes such as caspases, calpains, and matrix metalloproteinases.
	- Proteolytic cleavage can have important roles in various biological processes, including development, cell signaling, and disease. <br>*For example, proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein amyloid precursor protein (APP) can generate amyloid beta peptides that are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease*.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Proteolytic Cleavage**:
> Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes posses several enzyme for **cutting the proteins and peptides**.
> There are different types of proteolytic cleavage:
> 1. Removal of the **methadine** reside present at the start of each polypeptide (since the start codon also codes for methadine)
> 2. Removal of the **singal peptides**
> 
> Sometimes the cleavage signal is constituted by a single residue.
> However, in many cases the sequence motif is longer and ambiguos, luckily with a NN we can get a prediction accuracy above $98\%$.
> 
> Here are some example of ambiguos sequence motif
> - **Chymotrypsin** cuts polypeptides at the **C-terminal** of *bulky aromatic residues* (*~ex.: phenylalanine*)
> - **Trypsin** cuts the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues
> - **Elastase** cuts the peptide bond on the **C-terminal** of small residues (*~ex.: glycine* and *alanine*)
