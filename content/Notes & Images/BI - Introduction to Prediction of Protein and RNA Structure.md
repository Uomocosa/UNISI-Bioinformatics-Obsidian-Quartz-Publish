##### Questions
- ***What are Structural Proteins?***
	- ==Structural proteins are a class of proteins that play a key role in the structure and support of **cells**, **tissues**, and **organisms**==. <br>These proteins are ==typically long==, fibrous molecules that have a high degree of mechanical stability and are able to resist stretching and bending forces.
	- One of the most well-known examples of a structural protein is **collagen**, which is found in connective tissues such as skin, bone, and cartilage. <br>Collagen provides strength and support to these tissues, and is able to resist mechanical stress due to its high degree of cross-linking and its unique triple-helical structure.
	- Other examples of structural proteins include **keratin**, which is found in hair, nails, and the outer layer of skin, and elastin, which is found in elastic tissues such as blood vessels and lung tissue. <br>These proteins are all important for maintaining the structural integrity of cells and tissues, and are essential for the proper functioning of the body.
- ***What are Machanoenzymes?***
	- ==Mechanoenzymes are a class of enzymes that can convert mechanical forces or movements into biochemical reactions==. <br>They are also known as mechanochemical enzymes or molecular machines, and are found in a wide range of biological processes.
	- ==Mechanoenzymes work by using mechanical energy to change the conformation or position of their constituent molecules, which then triggers a chemical reaction==. <br>*One well-known example of a mechanoenzyme is **myosin**, which is responsible for muscle contraction*. <br>Myosin uses the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to generate mechanical force and movement, which is then converted into the sliding of actin filaments, leading to muscle contraction.
	- *Another example of a mechanoenzyme is **helicase**, which is involved in the unwinding of DNA during DNA replication and repair*. <br>Helicase uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to move along the DNA strand and separate the double-stranded DNA into two single strands, allowing the replication or repair machinery to access the genetic information.
	- ==Mechanoenzymes are important for many biological processes that involve force or movement==, and understanding their mechanisms of action can provide insights into the functioning of cells and organisms at the molecular level.
