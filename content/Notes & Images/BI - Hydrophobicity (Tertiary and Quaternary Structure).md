##### Questions
- ***Why is Hydrophobicity Important for the Tertiary and Quaternary Structure of Protiens?***
	- ==Hydrophobicity is a critical factor in determining the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins==. <br>==This is because hydrophobic interactions play a major role in **protein folding** and **stability**==.
	- Hydrophobic interactions occur between **nonpolar** or **hydrophobic molecules**, such as the side chains of certain amino acids (e.g., phenylalanine, leucine, and valine) that do not interact well with water molecules. <br>==In aqueous environments, hydrophobic side chains tend to cluster together and exclude water molecules from their vicinity==. <br>This clustering phenomenon is called the **hydrophobic effect**.
	- ==In proteins, hydrophobic side chains tend to be buried in the protein's interior, away from water molecules==. <br>==This is because the hydrophobic effect drives the protein to fold in such a way as to minimize the exposure of hydrophobic groups to water. <br>The hydrophobic core that is formed in the protein's interior is critical for its stability and proper folding==.
	- ==In addition, hydrophobic interactions also play a role in protein-protein interactions in the quaternary structure of proteins. <br>**Protein subunits in a multimeric protein complex tend to associate with each other through hydrophobic interactions between their surfaces**. <br>This is because the hydrophobic patches on one subunit tend to interact favorably with the hydrophobic patches on another subunit, while the polar or charged surfaces tend to interact less favorably with each other==.
	- In summary, hydrophobic interactions are important for the folding, stability, and protein-protein interactions of proteins, and they play a critical role in determining the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Hydrophobicity for the Tertiary and Quaternary Structure***:
> Usually a protein is composed of an **hydroPHOBIC** core buried by **hydroPHILIC** peptides (polar and charged residues), exposed to the solvent.
> This process of folding into a compact conformation, that isolate hydrophobic residues from the solvent is called **hydrophobic collapse**
> ![[Pasted image 20230113154434.png]]

> #IMPORTANTE **Integral Membrane Proteins**: are an exeption to the hydrophobic rule, in fact they have an hydrophobic **superficial region**, which is incapsulated by the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane:

> #IMPORTANTE ***Importance of the hydrophobic isolation***:
> One case where the protein mutates and uncovers its hydrophobic core, is in the pathology called **sickle cell anemia**:

> This pathology is created with only one changed residue, from a glutamic acid (charged) if it becomes a valine (hydrophobic), the red blood cell looses its round shape, and becomes a sickle that can bind to other sickles obstructing the flow of blood, all this becose the glutamic acid **GAG** became a valine **GUG**.
