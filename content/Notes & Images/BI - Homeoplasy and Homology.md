##### Questions
- ***What are Homoplasy and Homology, what are their Differences?***
	- ==**Homoplasy** and **homology** are two terms used in evolutionary biology to describe similarities between species==, but they have different meanings.
		- ==Homology refers to similarities that are the result of common ancestry==. <br>In other words, homologous structures are those that are inherited from a common ancestor and have similar structures, functions, or both. <br>*For example, the wings of birds and the arms of humans are homologous structures because they are inherited from a common ancestor and have similar skeletal structures*.
		- ==Homoplasy, on the other hand, refers to similarities that are not the result of common ancestry, but rather are the result of **convergent evolution**, **parallel evolution**, or **evolutionary reversal**==. <br>In other words, homoplastic structures are those that have similar functions or structures, but are not inherited from a common ancestor. <br>*For example, the wings of birds and the wings of insects are homoplastic structures because they have similar functions (flight), but they are not inherited from a common ancestor and have different structures*.
	- In general, homology is used to infer evolutionary relationships between species, while homoplasy is a challenge for inferring such relationships.
- ***What is Convergent Evolution?***
	- ==Convergent evolution refers to the process by which unrelated organisms independently evolve similar traits or characteristics due to similar selection pressures in their environment==. <br>These traits or characteristics are analogous, meaning they are similar in function but do not share a common ancestor or evolutionary origin.
	- *For example, the wings of birds and the wings of bats are analogous structures that both evolved for flight, but they have different evolutionary origins* (birds are descendants of theropod dinosaurs, while bats are mammals). <br>*Another example is the streamlined body shape of dolphins and sharks, which both evolved for efficient movement through water, but again, they are not closely related in evolutionary terms*.
