##### Questions
- ***What are CpG Islands?***
	- CpG islands are regions of DNA that contain high numbers of CpG dinucleotides, where a cytosine (C) is followed by a guanine (G). <br>They are typically found in the promoter regions of approximately 60-70% of human genes, although they are also present in other regions of the genome.
	- ==CpG islands are important for gene regulation because they are often unmethylated==, meaning that the cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide is not modified by the addition of a methyl group. <br>==Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is a common epigenetic modification that can repress gene expression==. <br>==By contrast, unmethylated CpG islands are associated with active gene expression and can act as regulatory elements for transcription factors and other gene regulatory proteins==.
	- ==CpG islands are defined as DNA sequences that are at least 200 base pairs long, have a GC content greater than 50%, and a ratio of observed to expected CpG dinucleotides greater than 0.6==. <br>However, not all CpG-rich regions are CpG islands, as many are **methylated** and do not function as gene regulatory elements.
	- Aberrant methylation of CpG islands has been implicated in the development of many diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. <br>Hypermethylation of CpG islands can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, while hypomethylation can lead to the activation of oncogenes.
	- Overall, CpG islands are an important feature of the genome and play a critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Difference of saying CpG and CG***:
> CpG is a dinucleotide, which is two nucleoutides bonded by phosodiester bond, we evidensiate the “**p**” that stands for phospate. ==CpG are two nucleotides on the **same strand on DNA**==
> CG or GC are bounded by $3$ hydrogen bond. ==CG are two nucleotides on the **different strand on DNA**==

> #IMPORTANTE ***Definition of CpG Island***:
> Taken a strand of DNA of $200+$ length, the percentage of **CpG** is grater that $50\%$
> 
> Which is a lot beacause on average the DNA of eukaryots has only $20\%$ of “what it should have” of **CpG** content, expected percentage, 1 out of 16 possible nucleotides: $1/16 = 6.25\%$, actual percentage only $1\%$, in humans

> #IMPORTANTE ***Deamination***:
> A common chemical damage that can happen on the DNA:
> Due to **deamination** a **cythosine** becomes an **uracil** ![[Pasted image 20230211180948.png]]
> Tho the Uracil is not one of the four basis (A, C, T, G), and it is then removed by **DNA repair mechanisms**.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Methylation***:
> A specif enzyme, DNA methylase, can change a **cythosine** into an **5-methylcythosine**:
> ![[Pasted image 20230211181337.png]]  ![[Pasted image 20230211181315.png]]
> This is a problem because when deamination happens, it does not transform it in an **uracil** but in a **thymin**, which **IS** one of the four bases:
> ![[Pasted image 20230211181510.png]]
> This tymine is not easily removed and more changes like this stack up during evolution.
> This process, called **CpG suppression**, is the cause of the low percentage of **CpG** in **vertebrates**.
> While **invertebrates** don’t have this problem because they have no or low methylation.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Mammal Unmethylated Promotes***
> About $60\%$ of mammalian **promoters** have **CpG** islands, also most of them are **unmethylated**.
> ![[Pasted image 20230211182121.png]]
> 
> In particular **CpG islands** are **especially common** near the transcription site of **housekeeping genes**, which are genes necessary for basic survival functions of the cell, and are found in all cells.
> 
> The CpG island in **promoter regions** remain **unmethylated** in **active genes**
> The CpG island in **promoter regions** of **inactive genes** get **methylated**
> ⇒ **Methylation** of **CpG islands promoters** prevents binding of transcription factors, resulting in “**genes silencing**”.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Chromatin***:
> ![[Pasted image 20230211190303.png]]
> 
> A Chromatin is a package composed of 30% DNA, 60% Histones and 10% RNA (newly formed or in the process of forming).
> ==Chromosomes are made from chromatin==.
> Chromatin can be found in two forms:
> 1. **Euchromatin**: forming a shape like “beads on a string” where the DNA is “**loosly tide to the histones**” and are the sites where genes are more **active**
> 2. **Heterochromatine**: histones wrapped into tight helices, in these sites the gens are much less actives, due to the lack of space for the RNA Polymerase to start trascribing.
>
> The DNA is a double chain of nucleotides
> The DNA is wrapped around 8 histones (called an **octamer**), which form **chromatin**
> **Chromatin** is then folded repetedly to form **chromatid**, which “one half” of what we immagine when thinking of a chromosome
> A **Chromosome** form an X shape only in the process of micosys (Cell Duplication), where two identical **chromatid** are formed.
> 
> The forms in which the **chromatin** is found, **euchromatin** (loosly packed) and **heterochromatin** (heavily packed) is influenced by the **CpG islands**:
> Chromatine with a high density of **CpG** islands (so low methylation) shows an high level of **acetylation** on the H3 and H4 histons (think of them as more positively charged) while the H1 histon is **NOT acetylated**.
> ![[Pasted image 20230211191908.png]]
> So the high positive charge of the **H1** **histone** is reduced, causing the cromatine to be less tightly packed and therefor making DNA strands more accessible for the RNA polymerase, making this a region much more active in terms of gene expression.
> #IMPORTANTE ***Why are CpG Islands fint to act as Promoters?***
> Perhaps it’s simply because the high frequency of guanines and cythosines increases the probability that transcription factors will bind.
> ***Online Resource***: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ayp7ReOUG8)

> #IMPORTANTE **CpG Suppression**
> **CpG** dinucleotides are rarely found outside of promoter regions, due to **CpG suppression**.
> **CpG** dinucelotides are prone to **methalyation**: 
> That is the process of cythosine
> A specif enzyme, DNA methylase, attacs the methyl group $CH_3$ to the cythosine, but only when it is present in dinucleotides $5’ - CG - 3’$.
> ==Due to methalyation and then deamination, the Cythosine of **CpG** dinucleotides, can turn into Tymine==.
