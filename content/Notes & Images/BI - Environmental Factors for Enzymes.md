- ***How can Environmental Factors influence Enzymes?***
	- ==Environmental factors can have a significant impact on the activity of enzymes==. <br>Enzymes are sensitive to changes in temperature, pH, salt concentration, and the presence of inhibitors or activators. <br>Here are some ways that environmental factors can influence enzymes:
	  1. **Temperature**: Enzymes have an optimal temperature range at which they are most active. <br>This temperature range varies depending on the enzyme and the organism from which it is derived. <br>Above the optimal temperature range, enzymes can denature and lose their activity.
	  2. **pH**: Enzymes have an optimal pH range at which they are most active. <br>Changes in pH can alter the charge distribution and conformation of the enzyme, affecting its ability to bind to substrate molecules.
	  3. **Salt concentration**: Enzymes are sensitive to changes in the ionic strength of their environment. <br>High salt concentrations can disrupt the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that hold the enzyme in its functional conformation, leading to a decrease in activity.
	  4. **Inhibitors and activators**: Enzyme activity can be regulated by the presence of molecules that inhibit or activate the enzyme. <br>Inhibitors can bind to the active site of the enzyme and prevent substrate binding, while activators can enhance substrate binding and catalysis.
	  5. **Substrate concentration**: Enzyme activity is often influenced by the concentration of substrate molecules. <br>At low substrate concentrations, enzyme activity may be limited by the availability of substrate molecules, while at high substrate concentrations, enzyme activity may become saturated and plateau.
	- Understanding how environmental factors influence enzyme activity is essential for optimizing enzymatic processes, such as industrial biocatalysis and medical enzyme therapies. It is also important for understanding how enzymes function in natural systems and how they respond to changes in their environment.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Factors that can alter the function of an Enzyme***:
> **Temperature**: higher temperature speeds up reaction (there are limits)
> **pH**: an enzyme has a certain pH it need to be in, an higher or lower pH will **deneurize** the enzyme, making it useless.
> **Enzyme Concentration**: Increasing an enzyme concentration will increse linearly its products.
> **Substrate Concentration**: Increasing a substrate concentration will increse linearly its products.
