##### Questions
- ***What is Glycosylation?***
	- ==Glycosylation is a biological process in which **sugar molecules**, called **glycans**, are **covalently** attached to **proteins**, **lipids**, or other biomolecules==. <br>This process is important for the proper function and stability of many proteins, and it can also affect their interactions with other molecules in the cell.
	- ==Glycosylation occurs in several stages, starting with the synthesis of the sugar molecules in the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. <br>These sugar molecules are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are modified and attached to proteins or lipids. <br>The resulting glycoproteins or glycolipids can have a variety of functions, including cell signaling, cell adhesion, and immunity==.
	- There are several types of glycosylation, including **N-linked glycosylation**, **O-linked glycosylation**, and **glycosylphosphatidylinositol** (**GPI**) **anchoring**. <br>Each type of glycosylation involves different enzymes and pathways, and can lead to different modifications of the target molecule.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Glycosylation**:
> *The process that permanently binds an oligosaccaride (a short chain of sugars) to the side chain of a residue on the protein surface*
> The presence of glycosylated residues can have a significan effect on protein folding, location, biological activity and interaction with other protein.
> 
> In eukaryotes there are two types of *glycosylation*:
> 1. **N-glycosylation**
> 2. **O-glycosylation**
> 
> ==The **N-glycosylation** is the addition of an **oligosaccaride** to an **asparagine** residue **during protein translation**==.
> 
> The main signal which indecate that an **asparagine** residue (**Asn**) has to be glycosylated is the local amino acid sequence Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr.
> (Where X corresponds to any residue, **except proline**)
> Tho, this siquence alone is not sufficient to determine glycosylation.
> 
> ~Ex.: N-glycosylation

> 
> ==The **O-glycosylation** is a **post-translational process** in which the **N-acetyl-glucosaminil tranfersase** binds an **oligosaccaride** to an **oxygen** atom of a **serine** or a **theronine** reside==.
> 
> Unlike the **N-glycosylation** there are no known sequence that mark a site for **O-glycosylation**.
> Except for the presence of proline and valine residues near the Ser or Thr which must be glycosalyted.

> ~Ex.: O-glycosylation

> 
> ==NN accuracy for **N-glycosylation**:== $75\%$
> ==NN accuracy for **O-glycosylation**==: $85\%$ (higher even if almost none known sequence)
