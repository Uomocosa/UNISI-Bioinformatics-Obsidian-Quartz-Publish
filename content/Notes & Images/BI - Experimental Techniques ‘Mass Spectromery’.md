##### Questions
- ***What is the Mass Spectromery Technique?***
	- ==Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical technique used for identifying and quantifying molecules based on their mass-to-charge ratio==. <br>In the context of proteomics, MS is used for the identification and quantification of proteins and their post-translational modifications.
	- ==The basic principle of MS involves ionizing a molecule and then separating and detecting the resulting ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio==. <br>The ionization process can be achieved using a variety of techniques, including electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and others. <br>Once ionized, the resulting ions are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio using a mass analyzer, such as a quadrupole, time-of-flight (TOF), or orbitrap. <br>The separated ions are then detected and measured, providing information on the mass and abundance of each ion.
	- In proteomics, MS is often coupled with liquid chromatography (LC), a technique for separating complex protein mixtures based on their physical and chemical properties. <br>This combination, known as LC-MS, allows for the identification and quantification of thousands of proteins in a single experiment. <br>==In addition, MS can be used to identify post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and acetylation, by detecting and characterizing the modified peptides==.
	- MS has revolutionized the field of proteomics, enabling the identification and quantification of large numbers of proteins and PTMs from complex biological samples. <br>MS-based proteomics has a wide range of applications, including biomarker discovery, drug discovery, and understanding biological pathways and mechanisms.

##### IMPORTANTE


> #IMPORTANTE **Mass Spectrometry**:
> In mass spectometors samples may be introduced in any state (solid, liquid, gas)
> If the substance is solid or liquid it needs to be made **volatile**, before entering the ***ionization phase***, during which the molecules of the compound are ionized, in the most common case by the interaction with an electron beam
> The ionized molucules are then “*curved*” by a *magnetic field*, finally these molecules collide with a “***collector***” placed at the end of the analyzer, such collision generate an electrical current that can be registered and measured, we will obtain **a series of peaks of current**.

> In the mass spectrum graph the $x$-axis shows the values of the $\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{charge}}$ ratio.
> The $y$-axis is the relative abundance of the analyzed ions.
