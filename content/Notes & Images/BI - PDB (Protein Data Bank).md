##### Questions
- ***What are PDB (Protein Data Bank)?***
	- ==**The Protein Data Bank** (**PDB**) is a publicly accessible online repository that contains information about the three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies==. <br>The PDB is an important resource for researchers in the fields of structural biology, bioinformatics, and drug discovery.
	- The PDB was established in 1971 as a centralized resource for storing and sharing data on protein structures. <br>Since then, it has grown to contain over 180,000 structures, making it the largest collection of experimentally determined biological macromolecular structures in the world.
	- Each entry in the PDB includes a unique identifier, a description of the macromolecule, the experimental method used to determine its structure, and the coordinates for each atom in the molecule. <br>The PDB also provides tools for visualizing, analyzing, and comparing structures, as well as resources for downloading and analyzing the data.
	- The PDB is maintained by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) consortium, which consists of organizations from around the world responsible for archiving and disseminating biological macromolecular structure data. <br>The PDB is freely available to researchers and the general public, and has become an essential tool for understanding the structure and function of biological macromolecules.

> #IMPORTANTE **PDB again**
> *Protein Data Bank* the **standard file format** which contains all the information on the 3D structure of the protein, as well as its amminoacid chain, all the information is stored in text format (or in **mmCIF**, macromolecular Crystallographic Information File)
> Eahc line of a PDB file contains the coordinates ($x, y, z$) in **angrstroms** ($\AA = 10^{-10} \ \text{m}$ ).
> Also a navigable 3D representation of the protein can be obtained from PDB files.
