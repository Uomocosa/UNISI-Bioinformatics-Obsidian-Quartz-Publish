##### Questions
- ***What are Electron Microscopy Structures?***
	- ==**Electron microscopy** (**EM**) is a technique used to visualize the structures of biological molecules and complexes at high resolution==. <br>In the context of bioinformatics, EM structures refer to structures of these biological molecules that have been determined using electron microscopy.
	- ==EM works by passing a beam of electrons through a sample of the biological molecule or complex, which scatters the electrons and produces a pattern that can be recorded and analyzed==. <br>By collecting many such patterns from different orientations of the molecule, a three-dimensional structure of the molecule can be reconstructed using specialized computational algorithms.
	- EM can provide high-resolution structures of **large and complex** biological molecules, such as viruses, ribosomes, and molecular machines. <br>EM structures can also provide insights into the interactions between different molecules and the dynamic behavior of these complexes.
	- Recent advancements in EM technology, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-particle analysis, have greatly improved the resolution and accuracy of EM structures, making it a valuable tool for structural biology and drug discovery.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Electron Microscopy Structures**
> *See directly the molecules of the protein*
> It’s a new and powerful tool that can also see those proteins that the x-ray crystallography cannot, which are proteins either **too large** or **too heterogeneus** to be investigated by conventional X-ray cystallography or NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance).
> It still costs a lot.
