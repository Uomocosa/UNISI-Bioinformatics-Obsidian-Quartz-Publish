##### Questions
- ***What is the Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis Technique?***
	- ==Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) is a widely used technique for separating complex protein mixtures based on their **isoelectric point** (**pI**) and **molecular weight**==. <br>The technique involves two separate electrophoretic separations, with the first dimension separating the proteins based on their pI, and the second dimension separating the proteins based on their molecular weight.
	- The first dimension separation is achieved using isoelectric focusing (IEF), a technique that separates proteins based on their net charge. <br>==The proteins are placed onto a strip of a gel matrix with a **pH gradient**, and an electric field is applied, causing the proteins to migrate towards the point on the gel with a pH equal to their pI. <br>As a result, the proteins are separated based on their **pI**==.
	- The second dimension separation is achieved using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a technique that separates proteins based on their molecular weight. <br>==The proteins are first denatured and then separated based on their size by running them through a polyacrylamide gel matrix in the presence of SDS, a detergent that binds to the proteins and imparts a negative charge. <br>As a result, the proteins are separated based on their **molecular weight**==.
	- After the two-dimensional separation is complete, the separated proteins can be visualized by staining the gel with a protein stain such as Coomassie Blue or by transferring the proteins onto a membrane for further analysis, such as Western blotting.
	- Two-dimensional electrophoresis is a powerful technique for studying the proteome of a biological sample and has been used extensively in fields such as biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and drug discovery.

> Allows the separation of proteins according to their molecular weight and charge.
> #IMPORTANTE The “first dimension is called” ***isoelectric focusing***, the proteins collected from a tissue are placed on a *polymeric support strip* and are immersed in an *immobilazing gradient of acidity*, the protein will then move according to their pH to reach what is called an ==**isoelectric point**, which is a value of the **pH** at which a particular molecule carries no net electical charge== ![[Pasted image 20230117120036.png]]
> #IMPORTANTE At this point the *support* is placed on the margin of an *electrophoresis gel*, we “add the second dimension” which will focus the **molecular weigth** of the protein, an electric field is applied to the *gel* and the again the proteins will move reaching a point of stability:

> Mainly the diffuclty of identifing each protein at each dot (the human genome encodes many tens of thousands of proteins).
> Also the 2D electrophoresis is inadequate for the analysis of proteins that are very small or endowed with a little electric charge, but unluckly these proteins play an important role in many diseases.
> #IMPORTANTE It has some limitations but up to $20’000$ proteins can be found and analyzed in a singe tissue using this method.
