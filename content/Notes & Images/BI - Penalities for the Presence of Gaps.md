> #IMPORTANTE ***Indel Events***: (INsertion/DELetion)

> #IMPORTANTE ***Penalities for the Presence and the Length of a Gap***
> The scoring function has to reward alignments, that are most plausible from the evolutionary point of view.
> *~Ex.: an indel event creating a gap of 2 nucelotides (consecutives), is more probable than 2 indel event creating 2 gaps in different parts of the DNA*.
> The “loss function” can be: *-2 for a gap, -1 for each gap after the first*, and *+1 for each alignment, +0 for each missmatch*
