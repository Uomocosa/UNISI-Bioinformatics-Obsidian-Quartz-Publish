##### Questions
- ***What are Disulfide Bonds?***
	- ==Disulfide bonds are **covalent bonds** between two sulfur atoms that link two **cysteine** residues in a protein==.
		- ==**Cysteine** is the only amino acid with a **thiol** (-**SH**) group== in its side chain, and the thiol groups on two cysteine residues can undergo an **oxidation reaction** to form a covalent disulfide bond (**-S-S-**) between them.
	- ==Disulfide bonds are important for the stability and folding of proteins==. <br>They can help to stabilize the tertiary structure of a protein by forming covalent crosslinks between different regions of the polypeptide chain. <br>==Disulfide bonds can also be involved in protein-protein interactions==, and can act as a redox switch to regulate protein function.
	- The formation of disulfide bonds is catalyzed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), which help to ensure that the correct disulfide bonds are formed in the correct locations. <br>Misfolding or incorrect disulfide bond formation can lead to protein aggregation and disease.
	- Disulfide bonds are commonly found in proteins that are secreted or located in extracellular spaces, such as enzymes, antibodies, and hormones. <br>This is because the oxidizing environment of the extracellular space favors disulfide bond formation. <br>However, some intracellular proteins also contain disulfide bonds, and their formation is carefully regulated by the cell to ensure proper protein folding and function.

> #IMPORTANTE **Disulfide Bonds**: In the case of two **cysteine** residues it may happen that even if they are distant (in the amino acid chain), their sulfhydryl groups ($\mathrm{-SH}$) **oxidate** (they lose $\mathrm{+2e^{-} + 2H^{+}}$) and form a **covalent bond** know as disfulide bond. ![[Pasted image 20230114111740.png]]
