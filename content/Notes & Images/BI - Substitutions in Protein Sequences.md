- ***What are the Substitutions in Protein Sequences?***
	- Substitutions in protein sequences refer to changes in the amino acid sequence of a protein that result from a nucleotide substitution in the corresponding DNA sequence. <br>There are two types of substitutions: synonymous and non-synonymous.
		- ==**Synonymous substitutions** do not change the amino acid sequence because they occur in the third nucleotide position of a codon, which is often degenerate==. 
		- ==In contrast, **non-synonymous substitutions** can change the amino acid sequence and, therefore, the structure and function of the protein. <br>Non-synonymous substitutions can be further classified as **conservative** or **non-conservative**, depending on whether the new amino acid is similar or dissimilar in chemical properties to the original amino acid==.
