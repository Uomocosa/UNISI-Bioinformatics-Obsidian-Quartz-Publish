##### Question
- ***Why organisms have Preferences in the use of Codons?***
	- ==Organisms have preferences in the use of codons because the genetic code is degenerate, meaning that there are multiple codons that can code for the same amino acid. <br>*For example, the amino acid leucine can be coded for by six different codons: UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG*==.
	- However, different organisms tend to use different codons with different frequencies. <br>This is known as **codon usage bias**, and it is thought to be a result of a combination of factors, including **mutation**, **genetic drift**, and **natural selection**.
		- One factor that can influence codon usage is mutation. <br>Mutations can occur randomly in the genome, and some codons may be more susceptible to mutation than others. <br>Over time, this can lead to differences in the frequency of different codons within a genome.
		- Another factor that can influence codon usage is genetic drift. <br>Genetic drift refers to random fluctuations in the frequency of alleles within a population, and it can be particularly important in small populations. <br>If a particular codon happens to be more common in a small population, it may become fixed simply as a result of chance.
		- However, the most important factor influencing codon usage is thought to be natural selection. <br>==Different codons can be translated more efficiently by the ribosome, and some codons may be more energetically or metabolically favorable than others==. <br>In addition, some codons may be more susceptible to error during translation, leading to a higher rate of misincorporation of incorrect amino acids. <br>Natural selection can therefore favor the use of codons that are more efficient, favorable, or less error-prone, leading to differences in codon usage between different organisms.
	- Overall, codon usage bias is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a range of factors, including mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection. The study of codon usage can provide important insights into the biology and evolution of different organisms.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Codons Preferences***:
> Remember that the possible combination of 3 letters taken from (A, T, C, G) is equal to 64.
> ==There exist 64 **codons** but only 20 **amminoacids**==.
> So many codons map for the same amminoacids.
> From experiments it has been proved that each organism has a preference for which codon maps which amminacids.
> *~Ex.:* The codons that code for Argenine are 4: **CGT**, **CGC**, **CGG**, **AGG**, the yeast uses 48% the codon **AGA**, and only 10% the others.
> 
> This preferences is because of the need to avoid the random changes of a codon into a **stop codon**, and to ensure efficient translation by choosing codons that correspond to tRNA particularly abundant in the organism.

> #IMPORTANTE ***What is tRNA?***:
> L'**RNA transfer** (o RNA di trasporto), abbreviato in **tRNA**, è una piccola catena di RNA (costituita da circa 70-90 nucleotidi) che trasferisce un **amminoacido** specifico di una **catena polipeptidica in crescita** al **sito ribosomiale** della sintesi proteica durante la traduzione.
