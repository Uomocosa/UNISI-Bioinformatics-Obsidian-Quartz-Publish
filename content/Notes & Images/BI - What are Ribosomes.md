##### Questions
- ***What are Ribosomes?***
	- ==Ribosomes are complex molecular machines that are responsible for the **synthesis of proteins** in all living cells==. <br>==They are composed of a mixture of RNA and protein molecules, and exist in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells==. <br>==Ribosomes function by translating the genetic information stored in messenger RNA (mRNA) into the amino acid sequence of a protein==.
	- The structure of a ribosome is divided into two subunits: a small subunit and a large subunit. <br>The small subunit binds to the mRNA molecule, while the large subunit contains the enzymatic activity responsible for linking amino acids together to form a protein chain.
	- Ribosomes consist of three major RNA molecules, which are called ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules, and a large number of proteins. <br>The rRNA molecules are the primary structural components of the ribosome, while the proteins play a more regulatory role. <br>In eukaryotic cells, the ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm, while in prokaryotic cells, they are found in the cytoplasm and also associated with the cell membrane.
	- ==The process of protein synthesis begins with the binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the mRNA molecule. <br>This allows the ribosome to scan the mRNA molecule for the start codon, which is typically **AUG**==. <br>Once the start codon is identified, the large ribosomal subunit binds to the small subunit, and protein synthesis begins.
	- During protein synthesis, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying amino acids bind to the ribosome, and the ribosome catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids. <br>The ribosome moves along the mRNA molecule, adding new amino acids to the growing protein chain until a stop codon is reached, which signals the end of protein synthesis.
	- Overall, ribosomes are essential molecular machines that play a central role in the process of protein synthesis, and are essential for the proper functioning of all living cells.

##### IMPORTANTE
> #IMPORTANTE **Ribosomes** in both **prokaryotes** and **ukaryotes** are what **translates** mRNA (or RNA) into a protein.

> #IMPORTANTE In **Eukaryotes** the location of ribosomes determines the location of the protein translated.
> - If the ribosome is a “**free floating ribosome**”, then the protein translated will be used inside the cell
> - If the ribosome is a “**membrane bound ribosome**”, then the protein translated will be used outside the cell
