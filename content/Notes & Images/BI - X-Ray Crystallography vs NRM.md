##### Questions
- ***What are the Differences between X-Ray Crystallography and NRM?***
	- Both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are powerful techniques used to determine the three-dimensional structures of biological molecules, but they have some key differences:
	  1. **Sample requirements**: X-ray crystallography requires the biological molecule of interest to be crystallized, whereas NMR spectroscopy can be used on molecules in solution. <br>==Crystallization can be a difficult and time-consuming process==, and not all biological molecules can be successfully crystallized.
	  2. **Structure determination**: X-ray crystallography generates a static, high-resolution structure of the biological molecule, while NMR spectroscopy generates a dynamic, low-resolution structure of the molecule in solution. <br>==X-ray crystallography provides detailed information== about the precise positions of atoms in the molecule, whereas NMR spectroscopy provides information about the overall shape and flexibility of the molecule.
	  3. **Molecular size**: ==X-ray crystallography is better suited for larger molecules==, typically those larger than 30 kDa, while NMR spectroscopy is better suited for smaller molecules, typically those smaller than 30 kDa.
	  4. **Timeframe**: ==X-ray crystallography typically requires several weeks to months to determine a structure==, whereas NMR spectroscopy can determine a structure in a matter of days.
	- In summary, both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are valuable techniques for determining the structures of biological molecules, and the choice between the two techniques depends on the specific properties of the molecule being studied and the research questions being addressed.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **X-ray Crystallography** vs **NMR**
> Both methods contain complementary information:
> - **Location of atoms**
> - **Distances among atoms**
> X-ray is more sensitive to the ***overall shape*** of the protein, and it gives an *unic precise protein* as a result.
> NMR is mostly sensitive on the **local atomic details**, it can be used on all protein (especially those that do not crystallize), but it given a set of *possible proteins*.
> 
> Both methods **cannot** analyze big proteins (a few hundreds nucleotides)
> 
> Their combination can provide a stronger justification for the resulting structure
