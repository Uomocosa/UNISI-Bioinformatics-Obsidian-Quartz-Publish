- ***What are the Differences between Static and Dinamic Neural Networks?***
	- Static and dynamic neural networks are two types of artificial neural networks that differ in terms of their architecture and behavior.
		- ==**Static neural networks** have a fixed architecture== that does not change during the training or inference process. <br>This means that the number of neurons, layers, and connections between them is predetermined and does not change based on the input data. <br>Examples of static neural networks include feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks with a fixed topology.
		- ==On the other hand, **dynamic neural networks** have a flexible architecture that can change during the training or inference process based on the input data. <br>This means that the number of neurons, layers, and connections can be added or removed dynamically, depending on the input data==. <br>Examples of dynamic neural networks include recursive neural networks, neural Turing machines, and neural architecture search models.
	- ==The main advantage of dynamic neural networks is their ability to adapt to different input sizes and types of data. <br>They can learn and generalize better than static neural networks, especially when dealing with sequential or time-series data. <br>However, dynamic neural networks are usually more complex and computationally expensive than static neural networks, which can make them more difficult to train and deploy==.
