##### Questions
- ***What is Horizontal Gene Transfer?***
	- **Horizontal gene transfer** (**HGT**) refers to the transfer of genetic material between different organisms, regardless of their evolutionary relationship. <br>This process is different from the traditional mechanism of gene transfer, which occurs vertically from parent to offspring.
	- ==Horizontal gene transfer can occur through several mechanisms, including conjugation, transformation, and transduction==.
		- In **conjugation**, two bacteria exchange genetic material through direct physical contact via a **conjugation bridge**.
		- In **transformation**, bacteria **take up DNA from their environment**, which can be released by the lysis of other bacteria.
		- In **transduction**, genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another via a **bacteriophage** (virus that infects bacteria).
	- Horizontal gene transfer can lead to the acquisition of new traits and capabilities by an organism, such as antibiotic resistance or the ability to degrade new types of compounds. <br>This process is especially important for bacteria, which can rapidly adapt to new environments and changing conditions.
	- Horizontal gene transfer has important implications for fields such as medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. <br>It can contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance and the emergence of new infectious diseases, but can also be harnessed to engineer new strains of bacteria with desirable traits. <br>Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of horizontal gene transfer is therefore an important area of research in genetics and microbiology.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Horizontal gene transfer**: Entire genes, a set of genes, or even whole chromosomes can be transfered from one organism to another, really useful for bacterial evolution since they do not reproduce sexually.

> #IMPORTANTE ***Horizontal Gene Transfer***
> There are 3 ways to tranfer a gene:
> 1. **Transformation**: prokaryotes take up free fragments of DNA found in the enviroment, ofter **plasmidis**
> 2. **Conjugation**: two cells unite temporarely and genetic material, like **plasmids** or **transposons** (“jumping genes”) are exanched
> 3. **Transduction**: DNA is transmtted from one cell to anather via **bacteriophages**
