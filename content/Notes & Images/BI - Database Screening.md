- ***What is Databese Screening?***
	- ==Database screening is a computational approach used in **drug discovery** and other research fields to **identify potential drug candidates** or bioactive compounds by searching large databases of chemical structures==.
	- The goal of database screening is to identify compounds that have similar structures or properties to a known bioactive compound or to a target molecule of interest. <br>This can be done using various computational methods, such as molecular similarity analysis, pharmacophore modeling, or machine learning algorithms.
	- Database screening typically involves the following steps:
	  1. Selection of a database of chemical structures, such as the **PubChem** database or the **DrugBank** database.
	  2. Identification of a bioactive compound or a target molecule of interest, which serves as a query to search the database.
	  3. Generation of a set of compounds from the database that are structurally similar or that match specific pharmacophore features of the query compound.
	  4. Screening of the selected compounds to identify those that have potential biological activity or that may serve as lead compounds for further optimization.
	- Overall, database screening is an important tool in drug discovery and other research fields, as it can help identify potential drug candidates or bioactive compounds in a rapid and efficient manner. <br>However, it is important to validate the results of database screening using experimental assays and to optimize the identified compounds for their intended use.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Database Screening**
> *We need a search algorithm that searches all possible binding conformations, within a “reasonable” amount of time.*
> The **SLIDE** (Screening for Ligands by Induced-fit Docking Efficently) aims at lowering the amount of coumpount it need to perform the docking algorithm.
> Also it construct an index of potential ligand, this process allows SLIDE to raplidly eliminate those ligands that are, for example, too large or too small to fit the model.
> It still takes hours or days to search a whole database, but it is a huge improvment.
