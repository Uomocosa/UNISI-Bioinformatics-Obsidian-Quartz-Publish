##### Questions
- ***What are Fold Category of Proteins?***
	- ==The fold category of proteins refers to the different structural classes or categories that proteins can be classified into based on their three-dimensional structure==. <br>Here are some common fold categories of proteins:
	  1. **Alpha/Beta**: Proteins in this category contain both alpha helices and beta sheets in their structure, with the two types of secondary structures often arranged in alternating layers.
	  2. **Alpha+Beta**: Proteins in this category also contain both alpha helices and beta sheets, but the two types of secondary structures are not as distinctly separated as in alpha/beta proteins.
	  3. **All-alpha**: Proteins in this category are dominated by alpha helices, with relatively few beta strands.
	  4. **All-beta**: Proteins in this category are dominated by beta sheets, with relatively few alpha helices.
	  5. **Alpha-helical bundles**: These proteins contain multiple alpha helices that are arranged in a bundle-like structure.
	  6. **Beta-barrels**: These proteins have a cylindrical shape and are made up of multiple beta strands that form a closed barrel-like structure.
	  7. **Coiled-coils**: Proteins in this category are formed by two or more alpha helices that are coiled together like a rope.
	  8. **Intrinsically disordered proteins**: These proteins do not adopt a fixed three-dimensional structure and instead exist as a flexible ensemble of conformations.
	- Fold category classification schemes are useful for understanding the relationship between the structure and function of proteins, as proteins with similar folds often share similar functions. <br>They can also provide insights into the evolution of protein structure and the development of novel protein functions.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Fold Category of Proteins**:
> Proteins are said to share a **common fold** if they have the same kind of 3D arrangment and with the same topological connection.
> ==A fold is (at most) a half of the total protein structure.==
> Fold category are not evolutionary related, differently from family and superfamily, since **the number of folds is limited**, and different proteins (with different functions) may have the same fold due to the mixing and matchin of **exons** during their evolution.

> #IMPORTANTE ***What are Introns and Exons?***
> A gene is composed of introns and exons:

> #IMPORTANTE **From DNA to Protein**:
> Starting DNA double Helix, in blue **Exons**, in red **Introns**: ![[Pasted image 20230116173939.png]]
> Using the RNA Polymerise (a protein) the corresponding mRNA is created: ![[Pasted image 20230116174100.png]]
> This is also called **pre-mRNA**
> This pre-mRNA need to be processed, **introns** needs to be removed:
> The “**mature-mRNA**” is defined by only **exons**: ![[Pasted image 20230116174219.png]]
> Now using a **ribosome** the process of **translation** will begun and the mRNA will be transcribed into a series of amminoacids: ![[Pasted image 20230116174438.png]] ![[Pasted image 20230116174457.png]] ![[Pasted image 20230116174519.png]] ![[Pasted image 20230116174545.png]]
> So the amminacid (or residue) chain (or polypeptide chain) is cretead, and the mature-mRNA will be discarded and recicled.
> Now the polypeptide chain will fold into a protein, the protein can be united with other protein, or not.
