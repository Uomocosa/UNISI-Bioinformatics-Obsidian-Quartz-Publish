- ***What is Misfolding?***
	- ==Misfolding is a phenomenon where a protein fails to adopt its native or biologically functional conformation and instead forms **non-native conformations**==. <br>Protein misfolding can occur due to a variety of factors, such as changes in the cellular environment, genetic mutations, errors in protein synthesis or processing, or exposure to chemical or environmental stressors.
	- Protein misfolding can have serious consequences for cellular function and can lead to the formation of protein aggregates, which are often associated with various diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. <br>In some cases, misfolded proteins can also form toxic oligomers or fibrils that can damage cells and tissues.
	- Protein misfolding can also have a broader impact on cellular metabolism, as misfolded proteins often interfere with other cellular processes and can trigger stress responses that can lead to cell death or damage. <br>Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of protein misfolding and developing strategies to prevent or treat it is an important area of research in biochemistry and biomedicine.
