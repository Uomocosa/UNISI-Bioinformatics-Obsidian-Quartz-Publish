##### Questions
- ***What is Phosphorylation?***
	- ==Phosphorylation is a biochemical process that involves the addition of a **phosphate group** to a molecule==. <br>In biological systems, phosphorylation most commonly refers to the addition of a phosphate group to a **protein**, which can affect the structure, function, and localization of the protein.
	- Phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, gene expression, and cell cycle regulation. <br>It is carried out by enzymes called kinases, which transfer phosphate groups from **ATP** (**adenosine triphosphate**) to specific amino acid residues on the protein substrate.
	- The most common amino acids that are phosphorylated in proteins are **serine**, **threonine**, and **tyrosine**, although other amino acids can also be phosphorylated in some cases. <br>==The addition of a phosphate group to these amino acids can alter the charge, shape, and/or conformation of the protein, thereby changing its activity, stability, or interactions with other molecules==.
	- Overall, phosphorylation is a critical process in the regulation of many biological pathways, and it plays a central role in cellular communication, metabolism, and growth.
