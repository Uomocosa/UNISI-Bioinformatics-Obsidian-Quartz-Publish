##### Questions
- ***What are Enzymes?***
	- ==Enzymes are biological molecules that catalyze, or speed up, chemical reactions in living organisms==. <br>==They are typically **proteins**, although some enzymes are made of **RNA** (known as **ribozymes**) or **protein-RNA complexes**==.
	- Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to occur, which allows the reaction to proceed at a faster rate than it would in the absence of the enzyme. <br>==Enzymes are highly specific==, meaning they only catalyze particular reactions and are not consumed in the process.
	- Enzymes are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and signal transduction. <br>Some examples of common enzymes and their functions include:
	  1. *Proteases*: enzymes that break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids.
	  2. *Lipases*: enzymes that break down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol.
	  3. *DNA polymerases*: enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of new DNA strands during DNA replication.
	  4. *Kinases*: enzymes that add phosphate groups to proteins, thereby regulating their activity.
	  5. *Hydrolases*: enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of chemical bonds, such as the cleavage of peptide bonds by proteases.
	- Enzymes are essential for life, and their malfunction can lead to diseases and disorders. <br>*For example, mutations in genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolism can lead to metabolic disorders, such as phenylketonuria and galactosemia*. <br>==Enzyme inhibitors are also used as drugs to treat a variety of conditions==, including infections, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE ***Enzymes***:
> Enzymes are manly proteins with a **round shape**.
> They act as **catalysts**, they speed up biologial reactions
> They are **highly specialized**, they can only act on one specific type of substance
> *Our body is a complex industry in which many aspcect must be regulated, and enzymes are responsible for such regulation.*
> *~Ex.:* enzyme controll the manifacture of complex tissues (like skin), and blood.
> *~Ex.:* Enzymes help breaking down chemicals to provide energy to the body.
> *~Ex.:* In most vertebrates, ***urea*** is a proteine used to eliminate the nitrogenous products of metabolism from the body, the enzyme ***urease*** catalyze this reaction, to make it into prospective, usrease catalyzes $30’000$ urea molecules **per second**, while without it, it would urea would take $3$ **MILLION years** to decompose itself in carbon dioxide and ammonia.
