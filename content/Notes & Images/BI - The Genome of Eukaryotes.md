##### Questions
- ***What is there to say about the Genome of Eukaryotes?***
	- The genome of eukaryotes is a complex structure that consists of DNA, RNA, and various types of proteins. <br>==Eukaryotic genomes are typically much larger and more complex than those of prokaryotes, and they often contain multiple copies of genes and non-coding regions that regulate gene expression==.
	- ==One of the most distinctive features of eukaryotic genomes is the presence of **introns**, which are non-coding regions of DNA that interrupt coding regions (**exons**) within genes==. <br>Introns are spliced out of pre-mRNA transcripts during RNA processing, resulting in mature mRNA that contains only exons. <br>==This **alternative splicing** process enables eukaryotic genes to encode multiple proteins from a single gene, contributing to the complexity and diversity of eukaryotic organisms==.
	- ==Another important feature of eukaryotic genomes is **chromatin**, the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up **chromosomes**==. <br>Chromatin undergoes various modifications, including histone modifications and **DNA methylation**, that regulate gene expression and contribute to epigenetic inheritance.
	- ==Eukaryotic genomes also contain **repetitive DNA sequences**, including transposable elements, which can move around within the genome and contribute to genetic diversity and evolution==. <br>Additionally, eukaryotic genomes often contain multiple copies of genes that encode proteins involved in complex cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell division, and differentiation.
	- In summary, eukaryotic genomes are complex structures that contain a variety of features that contribute to the complexity and diversity of eukaryotic organisms. <br>Understanding the organization and function of eukaryotic genomes is a crucial aspect of biological research and has important implications for fields such as medicine and biotechnology.

> #IMPORTANTE In **EUKARYOTES** the genome size doesn’t say how complex is an organism, different if we study the **number of different types of cell** an eukaryote is composed of, that will tell us how complex it is.

> #IMPORTANTE **The genome of ALL eukaryotes is found in the nucleus and it’s organized in chromosomes**
