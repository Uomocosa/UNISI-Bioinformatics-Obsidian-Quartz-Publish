##### Questions
- ***What is there to say about the GC Content in Eukaryotic Genomes?***
	- The GC content in eukaryotic genomes can vary widely between different organisms and even between different regions within a single genome. <br>==GC content refers to the percentage of nucleotides in a genome that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C)==.
	- ==In general, eukaryotic genomes tend to have a higher GC content than prokaryotic genomes==. <br>The average GC content of eukaryotic genomes is around 50%, although this can vary widely between different species. <br>*For example, ==the GC content of the human genome is approximately 42%==, while the GC content of the maize genome is approximately 38%*.
	- GC content can have important implications for genome structure and function. <br>==Regions of the genome with a high GC content are often associated with higher gene density and a higher frequency of CpG islands==, which are regions of DNA that contain high numbers of CpG dinucleotides. <br>CpG islands are often associated with gene promoters and can play a role in regulating gene expression.
	- ==However, high GC content can also be associated with higher rates of mutation and can lead to increased genomic instability==. <br>==In addition, regions of the genome with a low GC content can be more susceptible to damage from oxidative stress and other environmental factors==.
	- Overall, the GC content of eukaryotic genomes is a complex and dynamic feature that can have important implications for genome structure, function, and evolution.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE ***GC Content in EUKARYOTIC Genes***:
> - Not as much “random” as in **prokaryotic** genes
> - It’s also useful in **gene recognition algorithms**, because:
> 	- **Eukaryotic ORF** are much more difficult to recognize
> 	- When a large-scale variation of GC content is found in an eukaryotic DNA, that is a marker for **genes**, **upstream promoter**, for the choice of **codon**, the legth of genes and their density.
