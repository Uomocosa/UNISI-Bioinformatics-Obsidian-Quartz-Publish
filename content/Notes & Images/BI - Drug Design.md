##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Drug Design** is divided into **Discovery** and **Testing**.
> 
> **Discovery**:
> - **Target Identification** (what does the new drug have to do)
> - Discovery and optimization of **“lead” compounds**
> - **Toxicology** and **Pharmacokinetics** (study of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of drugs)
> 
> **Testing**:
> - **Pre-Clinical** test.
> - **Clinical** trials.

>  #IMPORTANTE ***Target Identification on Drug Design***:
> Consist of isolating a **biological molecule** that is essential for the survival or the proliferation of a particular agent called a “***pathogen***”, responsible for a disease.
> ==Most of the time the target is a **protein**==
> After we have identified the target we search for a **molecule** that binds to the target and inhibits its activity
