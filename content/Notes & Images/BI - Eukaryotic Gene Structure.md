##### Questions
- ***What is there to say about the Eukaryotic Gene Structure?***
	- ==The gene structure of eukaryotes is characterized by several distinct features, including the **presence of introns**, the use of **alternative splicing**, and the regulation of gene expression by cis- and trans-acting factors==.
	- ==In eukaryotes, a gene typically consists of a **promoter region**, which contains **binding sites** for **transcription** factors that initiate gene expression, followed by a **coding region**, which includes **exons** and **introns**==. <br>The exons contain the coding sequence for the protein, while the introns are non-coding regions that are transcribed but later spliced out during RNA processing. <br>This process of splicing results in the mature mRNA that only contains the coding regions, or exons.
	- Eukaryotic genes often contain multiple exons and introns, and the number and arrangement of these regions can vary widely between genes. <br>This variation contributes to the complexity and diversity of eukaryotic organisms, as alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts can generate multiple different protein isoforms from a single gene.
	- In addition to the basic structure of genes, eukaryotic gene expression is regulated by a variety of cis- and trans-acting factors. <br>Cis-acting elements are DNA sequences that are located close to the gene and can influence gene expression, such as enhancers and silencers. Trans-acting factors are proteins that bind to these cis-acting elements and either activate or repress gene expression.
	- Overall, the gene structure of eukaryotes is a complex and dynamic system that is tightly regulated by a variety of molecular mechanisms. <br>Understanding the structure and regulation of eukaryotic genes is a crucial aspect of biological research, with important implications for fields such as medicine and biotechnology.

> #IMPORTANTE One of the best way we have at the moment to find eukaryotic genes in their DNA is to search for a region where many “gene markers” are located, such as:
> - **Possible promoters**
> - Sequences that indicates the vicinity of **Introns** and **Exons**
> - A long **ORF** (Open Reading Frame)
