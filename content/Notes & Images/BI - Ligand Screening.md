##### Questions
- ***What is Ligand Screening?***
	- ==Ligand screening is a computational or experimental approach to identify small molecules, called **ligands**, that have the potential to bind to a specific target molecule, such as a protein or a nucleic acid==. <br>Ligand screening is used in **drug discovery** and other research fields to identify potential drug candidates or to understand the binding interactions between molecules.
		- **Computational ligand** screening involves using computer algorithms and simulations to predict the binding affinity of potential ligands to a target molecule. <br>This is done by generating a virtual library of small molecules and screening them against the target using various methods, such as molecular docking or molecular dynamics simulations. <br>The goal of computational screening is to identify ligands that have the highest predicted binding affinity and that are structurally compatible with the target.
		- **Experimental ligand** screening, on the other hand, involves testing a physical library of small molecules against the target molecule to identify ligands that bind with high affinity. <br>This can be done using techniques such as high-throughput screening, in which thousands or millions of compounds are screened in a short period of time, or fragment-based screening, in which smaller fragments of molecules are screened and then combined to form larger ligands.
	- Overall, ligand screening is an important tool for drug discovery and other research fields, as it can help identify potential drug candidates or lead to a better understanding of the molecular interactions between molecules.

> Traditionally the only method to discover new drugs was *trial-and-error*
> Recently new screening method (**HTS**: high throughput screening) have made this procedure much more efficient, even if the underling process is still ***an exhaustive search of the greatest possible number of lead compounds***.
