##### Questions
- ***What is the Protein Microarray Technique?***
	- ==A protein microarray is a high-throughput technology that allows for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple proteins in a single experiment==. <br>==The technique involves spotting hundreds or thousands of purified proteins, protein fragments, or antibodies onto a solid surface, such as a **glass slide or a membrane**, in a grid-like pattern==.
	- The samples are then incubated with a biological sample, such as a cell lysate or a serum sample, and the bound proteins are detected using a variety of techniques, including fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or mass spectrometry.
	- Protein microarrays can be used for a variety of applications, including:
	  1. **Protein-protein interaction studies**: The microarray can be used to identify novel protein-protein interactions by spotting bait proteins onto the array and detecting the binding of prey proteins.
	  2. **Antibody profiling**: The microarray can be used to detect the presence of antibodies in a biological sample, such as serum, and to determine their specificity and binding affinity.
	  3. **Biomarker discovery**: The microarray can be used to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in disease states, providing potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis or prognosis.
	  4. **Drug target discovery**: The microarray can be used to identify potential drug targets by identifying proteins that are overexpressed or dysregulated in disease states.
	- Protein microarrays have the advantage of being able to analyze large numbers of proteins simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive analysis of protein function and interaction. <br>==However, there are also limitations, such as the requirement for purified proteins and the need for high-quality antibodies for detection==.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Protein Microarrays**:
> Also called “**protein chips**”, they are the counter part to **microarrays** (or “**gene chips**”) for the study of the DNA.
> 
> ***Basic Concept***: 
> - Small amount of individual probes are covalently linked to the surface of the silicon chip in a high-density array.
> - Protein extracted from the cells are labeld with ***fluorophores*** and flushed on the chip
> - Just as with gene chips, the amount of material (in this case, proteins) bound to the probes is determined by the excitation of the fluorophore
> 
> ***Pros***: many proteins can be tracked and analyzed in parrallel.
> ***Pros***: the protein microarrays are utilized in many fields of study:
> 1. **Proteomics**, to detect protein expression profiles.
> 2. **Protein Functional Analysis** and **Protein-Protein Interaction**
> 3. Detection of **antigens** and **antibodies** in blood samples
> 4. **Antibody Characterization**
> 5. **Antigen-Specific Therapies** and **Treatments**
> 
> ***Cons***: Unlike DNA sequences, which have unique bonds (dictated by base coupling), a single protein can interact wiht multiple different probes.
> ***Cons***: Proteins are known to be sensitive to the chemistry of their envirnment and to surface they encounter.
> 
> For the time being, it’s easier to use gene chips (gene microarrays) as a base, which can help us point to the study of proteins of interest (restricting the search to a fewer number of proteins), and then perform the analysis on protein microarrays.
