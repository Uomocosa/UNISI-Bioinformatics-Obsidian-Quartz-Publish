##### Questions
- ***What are NMR Structures?***
	- **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance** (**NMR**) **spectroscopy** is a powerful technique used to determine the three-dimensional structures of biological molecules, such as **proteins** and nucleic acids. <br>In the context of bioinformatics, NMR structures refer to structures of these biological molecules that have been determined using NMR spectroscopy.
	- ==NMR spectroscopy works by applying a strong magnetic field to a sample of a biological molecule, causing its atomic nuclei to align with the field. <br>The sample is then exposed to radio waves, causing the atomic nuclei to absorb and re-emit energy at characteristic frequencies. <br>By measuring the frequencies and intensities of these signals, scientists can deduce information about the structure and dynamics of the molecule==.
	- NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable information about the structure and dynamics of biological molecules in solution, allowing researchers to study their interactions with other molecules, such as drugs or other proteins. <br>While NMR structures may not have the same level of accuracy as structures determined using X-ray crystallography, they can still provide important insights into the structure and function of biological molecules.

> #IMPORTANTE **NMR Structures**
> *Nuclear Magnetic Resonance*
> 
> The NMR method consinst in using the *phenomenon of resoance* produced by some elements (hydrogen and redioactive isotopes of carbon and nitrogen), when are immersed in a **static magnetic field**, and exposed to a **second oscillatic magnetic field**.
> These resonances can then be detected by external sensors.
> 
> The results of an NMR experiment are a **set of constraints** on the interatomic distances within a macromolecular structure.
> We can use this constraints as input to get the 3D structure of the protein.
> Often there are **some** proteins (not just one) that respect all constraints, so ==NMR returns a set of proteins==, not just one differenty from the crystallography
> 
> $13’800$ 3D models of proteins, as of now, have been created using NMR experiments.
