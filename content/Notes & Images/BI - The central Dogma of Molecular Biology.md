##### Questions
- ***What is the Central Dogma of Bioinformatics?***
	- The "Central Dogma" of bioinformatics refers to the fundamental process by which genetic information is stored, transmitted, and expressed in living organisms. <br>==The Central Dogma states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into protein==.
	- In more detail, the Central Dogma can be broken down into three basic steps:
	  1. ==**DNA replication**: The double-stranded DNA molecule is copied into two identical daughter molecules==.
	  2. ==**Transcription**: The DNA is used as a template to make a complementary RNA molecule through a process called transcription==. The RNA molecule is a single-stranded copy of the DNA sequence, and it carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome.
	  3. ==**Translation**: The RNA molecule is then translated into a protein by the ribosome==. <br>The sequence of nucleotides in the RNA molecule determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein, and thus the structure and function of the protein.
	- The Central Dogma is a fundamental concept in bioinformatics because it explains how genetic information is transferred from DNA to proteins, which are the primary functional molecules in cells. <br>Understanding the Central Dogma is essential for many areas of research in molecular biology, genetics, and biotechnology.

##### IMPORTANTE

> #IMPORTANTE **Enzymes** act as **catalysts** that speed up specifi chemical reaction, they are not consumed in this process, and can be used repeatedly for the same reaction
> Althoug they can become **denatured** (due to changin in their environment), if they do, enzymes become distorted and cannot be used again.

> #IMPORTANTE The instruction in the DNA that need to be **transcribed** are stored in **genes** (particular region of the DNA)
> #IMPORTANTE The process of extracting information from genes, is shared by all leaving organisms.
> #IMPORTANTE ==The **DNA** is **transcribed** into a single-strand polynucleotide chain, the **RNA** (ribonucleic acid) by the **RNA-Polymerase** enzyme==
> #IMPORTANTE The nucleobase of the DNA are trascribed one by one into the RNA, exept for the **Tymine** (**T**) that is transcribed into **Uracil** (**U**)
